We performed\na systematic review to identify a final sample of 13 empirical studies that\nreport rankable feature importance. From these papers, we extracted and\ncategorized 58 unique predictors, synthesizing their importance using a\nWeighted Importance Score (WIS) that balances a feature's average rank with its\nfrequency of appearance. We also conducted a moderator analysis to investigate\nhow predictor importance changes with context (e.g., success definition).\n  Results: Our aggregate analysis reveals that the most consistently powerful\npredictors are a quartet of foundational attributes: Firm Characteristics\n(e.g., age, location), Investor Structure (e.g., investor quality), Digital and\nSocial Traction (e.g., online momentum), and Funding History.

By targeting the\nleast significant bit (LSB) of non-transparent alpha layer image values, the\nproposed method successfully conceals compressed JavaScript code inside a\nfavicon image without affecting visual fidelity. Global web traffic loads 294\nbillion favicons daily and consume 0.9 petabytes of network bandwidth. A\nproof-of-concept implementation demonstrates that a 64x64 ICO image can embed\nup to 512 bytes uncompressed, or 0.8 kilobyte when using lightweight two-fold\ncompression. On page load, a browser fetches the favicon as part of standard\nbehavior, allowing an embedded loader script to extract and execute the payload\nentirely in memory using native JavaScript APIs and canvas pixel access. This\ncreates a two-stage covert channel requiring no additional network or user\nrequests. Testing across multiple browsers in both desktop and mobile\nenvironments confirms successful and silent execution of the embedded script.\nWe evaluate the threat model, relate it to polymorphic phishing attacks that\nevade favicon-based detection, and analyze evasion of content security policies\nand antivirus scanners. We map nine example MITRE ATT&CK Framework objectives\nto single line JavaScript to execute arbitrarily in ICO files.

The results demonstrate a\nstealthy and reusable attack surface that blurs traditional boundaries between\nstatic images and executable content. Because modern browsers report silent\nerrors when developers specifically fail to load ICO files, this attack surface\noffers an interesting example of required web behaviors that in turn compromise\nsecurity."}

This paper introduces Lap,\nour novel approach to LLM-based Automatic Playtesting, which uses ChatGPT to\ntest match-3 games, a category of games where players match three or more\nidentical tiles in a row or column to earn points. Lap encompasses three key\nphases: processing of game environments, prompting-based action generation, and\naction execution.

Metacognitive prompts developed in the human decision making\nliterature are designed to achieve this, and as I demonstrate here, they show\npromise with LLMs. The prompt I focus on here is \"could you be wrong?\"\nFollowing an LLM response, this prompt leads LLMs to produce additional\ninformation, including why they answered as they did, errors, biases,\ncontradictory evidence, and alternatives, none of which were apparent in their\ninitial response. Indeed, this metaknowledge often reveals that how LLMs and\nusers interpret prompts are not aligned.

This paper proposes the\nQuantum-Resilient Privacy Ledger (QRPL) as an innovative token-based digital\ncurrency architecture that incorporates National Institute of Standards and\nTechnology (NIST)-standardised post-quantum cryptography (PQC) with hash-based\nzero-knowledge proofs to ensure user sovereignty, scalability, and transaction\nconfidentiality. Key contributions include adaptations of ephemeral proof\nchains for unlinkable transactions, a privacy-weighted Proof-of-Stake (PoS)\nconsensus to promote equitable participation, and a novel zero-knowledge\nproof-based mechanism for privacy-preserving selective disclosure. QRPL aims to\naddress critical shortcomings in prevailing CBDC designs, including risks of\npervasive surveillance, with a 10-20 second block time to balance security and\nthroughput in future monetary systems.

Most recently, Bhargava et al.\n(2024) provided a systematic comparison of DT with more conventional MLP-based\noffline RL algorithms, including Behavior Cloning (BC) and Conservative\nQ-Learning (CQL), and claimed that DT exhibits superior performance in\nsparse-reward and low-quality data settings.\n  In this paper, through experimentation on robotic manipulation tasks\n(Robomimic) and locomotion benchmarks (D4RL), we show that MLP-based Filtered\nBehavior Cloning (FBC) achieves competitive or superior performance compared to\nDT in sparse-reward environments. FBC simply filters out low-performing\ntrajectories from the dataset and then performs ordinary behavior cloning on\nthe filtered dataset. FBC is not only very straightforward, but it also\nrequires less training data and is computationally more efficient.

We then analyze 13 documents with policies\nand usage guidelines for GenAI tools and conduct a developer survey to uncover\nthe ethical, legal, and practical concerns behind them. Our findings reveal\nthat developers actively manage how GenAI is used in their projects,\nhighlighting the need for project-level transparency, attribution, and quality\ncontrol practices in the new era of AI-assisted software development.

The second step leverages\nthese representations to generate a money laundering scoring of all\nobservations. A two-thresholds approach is then introduced, which ensures a\ncontrolled false-positive rate by means of the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH)\nprocedure.

However, Federated Recommender Systems (FedRecs) greatly suffer from\ntwo major problems: i) extremely high communication overhead due to massive\nitem embeddings involved in recommendation systems, and ii) intolerably low\ntraining efficiency caused by the entanglement of both heterogeneous network\nenvironments and client devices. Although existing methods attempt to employ\nvarious compression techniques to reduce communication overhead, due to the\nparameter errors introduced by model compression, they inevitably suffer from\nmodel performance degradation. To simultaneously address the above problems,\nthis paper presents a communication-efficient FedRec framework named FedRAS,\nwhich adopts an action-sharing strategy to cluster the gradients of item\nembedding into a specific number of model updating actions for communication\nrather than directly compressing the item embeddings. In this way, the cloud\nserver can use the limited actions from clients to update all the items. Since\ngradient values are significantly smaller than item embeddings, constraining\nthe directions of gradients (i.e., the action space) introduces smaller errors\ncompared to compressing the entire item embedding matrix into a reduced space.\nTo accommodate heterogeneous devices and network environments, FedRAS\nincorporates an adaptive clustering mechanism that dynamically adjusts the\nnumber of actions.

We demonstrate how common\nanti-patterns -- such as inadequate baseline comparisons that conflate\nengineering effort with algorithmic novelty, workload selections that fail to\nrepresent production scenarios, and metric normalizations that hide substantial\nperformance variability like generation stalls-lead to misleading conclusions.\nTo address these challenges, we provide a comprehensive checklist derived from\nour analysis, establishing a framework for recognizing and avoiding these\nanti-patterns in favor of robust LLM inference evaluation. To demonstrate the\npractical application of our framework, we present a case study analyzing\nspeculative decoding, a technique whose bursty, non-uniform token generation is\neasily misinterpreted when evaluated using approaches characteristic of these\nanti-patterns. Our work establishes a rigorous foundation for evaluation\nmethodology, enabling meaningful comparisons, ensuring reproducible results,\nand ultimately accelerating genuine progress in LLM inference systems by moving\nbeyond common anti-patterns to align evaluation with real-world requirements."}

However, POI attribution remains challenging due to GPS\ninaccuracies, typically ranging from 2 to 20 meters in real-world settings, and\nthe high spatial density of POIs in urban environments, where multiple venues\ncan coexist within a small radius (e.g., over 50 POIs within a 100-meter radius\nin dense city centers). Relying on proximity is therefore often insufficient\nfor determining which POI was actually visited. We introduce\n\\textsf{POIFormer}, a novel Transformer-based framework for accurate and\nefficient POI attribution. Unlike prior approaches that rely on limited\nspatiotemporal, contextual, or behavioral features, \\textsf{POIFormer} jointly\nmodels a rich set of signals, including spatial proximity, visit timing and\nduration, contextual features from POI semantics, and behavioral features from\nuser mobility and aggregated crowd behavior patterns--using the Transformer's\nself-attention mechanism to jointly model complex interactions across these\ndimensions. By leveraging the Transformer to model a user's past and future\nvisits (with the current visit masked) and incorporating crowd-level behavioral\npatterns through pre-computed KDEs, \\textsf{POIFormer} enables accurate,\nefficient attribution in large, noisy mobility datasets. Its architecture\nsupports generalization across diverse data sources and geographic contexts\nwhile avoiding reliance on hard-to-access or unavailable data layers, making it\npractical for real-world deployment.

It is shown that\nby carefully tuning the membrane potential leakage constant of the spiking\nLeaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons used within our SNN, it is possible to\nachieve on-par robot control precision compared to the use of a non-spiking\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN). Finally, the LIDAR dataset collected during\nthis work is released as open-source with the hope of benefiting future\nresearch."}

LoRA is also communication-efficient for federated\nLLMs when multiple users collaboratively fine-tune a global LLM model without\nsharing their proprietary raw data. However, even the transmission of local\nadapters between a server and clients risks serious privacy leakage. Applying\ndifferential privacy (DP) to federated LoRA encounters a dilemma: adding noise\nto both adapters amplifies synthetic noise on the model, while fixing one\nadapter impairs the learnability of fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose\nFedASK (Differentially Private Federated Low Rank Adaptation with Double\nSketching) , a novel federated LoRA framework to enable effective updating of\nboth low-rank adapters with robust differential privacy. Inspired by randomized\nSVD, our key idea is a two-stage sketching pipeline.

In our simulation, prey and predator agents co-evolve their innate\nreward functions, including a possibly fear-like term for observing predators,\nand learn behaviors via reinforcement learning. Surprisingly, our simulation\nrevealed that social reward for observing the same species is more important\nfor prey to survive, and fear-like negative reward for observing predators\nevolves only after acquiring social reward. We also found that the predator\nwith increased hunting ability (larger mouth) amplified fear emergence, but\nalso that fear evolution is more stable with non-evolving predators that are\nbad at chasing prey. Additionally, unlike for predators, we found that positive\nrewards evolve in opposition to fear for stationary threats, as areas with\nabundant leftover food develop around them.
