We utilize this framework to parameterize the\none-dimensional advection-dispersion equation model, incorporating immobile\nphase exchange through a memory function. We solve the governing equation\nanalytically in the Laplace domain and numerically invert it to generate\nsynthetic breakthrough curves for different memory functions and boundary\nconditions. A dimensionless formulation enables decoupling the estimation of\nadvection velocity from other parameters, significantly reducing the number of\nrequired forward solutions. To improve computational efficiency, we apply a\nKarhunen-Loeve (KL) expansion to transform the synthetic dataset into a\nreduced-order space. Given a measured breakthrough curve, we estimate the\nadvection velocity by minimizing the distance from the measurement to the\nsynthetic data in KL space, and infer the remaining dimensionless parameters by\nProjected Barycentric Interpolation (PBI). We benchmark our method against\nseveral alternatives, including Laplace domain fitting, moment matching, global\nrandom optimization, and variations of the DSTE framework using\nnearest-neighbor interpolation and neural network-based estimation. Applied to\n295 breakthrough curves from 54 tracer tests in 25 rivers, DSTE delivers\naccurate parameter estimates. The resulting labeled dataset allows researchers\nto link transport parameters with hydraulic conditions, site characteristics,\nand measured concentrations. The synthetic dataset can be leveraged for the\nanalysis of new breakthrough curves, eliminating the need for additional\nforward simulations."}

It is based on a high-temporal-resolution (1\nsecond) wind measurements obtained from a transmission line in Slovenia,\nEurope. Wind speed and direction variability are analysed, and two averaging\nmethods, namely vector averaging, where velocity is averaged as vector, and\nhybrid averaging, where speed is averaged as scalar, are employed. DTR\ncalculations are performed on both high-resolution data and averaged data (5\nminute averaging window). It is demonstrated that averaging has a significant\neffect on both Nusselt number and ampacity, and the effect exhibits a strong\nangular dependency on the relative angle of the wind to the line. Therefore,\ntwo limit cases are studied: in the case of parallel wind, averaged data\nunderestimates the ampacity, and there is a significant amount of cases where\nthe underestimation is larger than 10 %. In the case of perpendicular wind, the\ntwo averaging methods affect the results in different ways, but both result in\na substantial amount of cases where ampacity is overestimated, potentially\nleading to unsafe operation. The main takeaway of the study is that averaging\nwind velocity has a significant impact on DTR results, and special emphasis\nshould be given to the averaging method, as different methods affect the\nresults in different ways."}

Though recent studies capture subsets of these factors, a\nunified framework quantifying the geometry of their interplay is missing. We\nframe verifiable test-time scaling as a transport problem. This characterizes\nthe interaction of coverage, ROC, and sub-optimality, and uncovers that the\nsub-optimality--coverage curve exhibits three regimes. A transport regime --\nwhere sub-optimality increases with coverage, a policy improvement regime --\nwhere sub-optimality may decrease with coverage, depending on the verifier's\nROC, and a saturation regime -- where sub-optimality plateaus, unaffected by\ncoverage.

As part of\nthis, Automated Programming Assessment Systems (APASs) have emerged, providing\nscalable and high-quality assessment systems with efficient evaluation and\ninstant feedback.

Although the\nresource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) lies at the core of\nproject management activities, it remains largely disconnected from the broader\nliterature on model-based systems engineering (MBSE), thereby limiting its\nintegration into the design and management of complex systems. The original\ncontribution of this paper is twofold. First, the paper seeks to reconcile the\nRCPSP with the broader literature and vocabulary of model-based systems\nengineering and hetero-functional graph theory (HFGT). A concrete translation\npipeline from an activity-on-node network to a SysML activity diagram, and then\nto an operand net is constructed. Using this representation, it specializes the\nhetero-functional network minimum-cost flow (HFNMCF) formulation to the RCPSP\ncontext as a systematic means of HFGT for quantitative analysis and proves that\nthe RCPSP is recoverable as a special case of a broader model. Secondly, on an\nillustrative instance with renewable and non-renewable operands, the\nspecialized HFNMCF, while producing similar schedules, yields explicit\nexplanations of the project states that enable richer monitoring and control.\nOverall, the framework preserves the strengths of the classical RCPSP while\naccommodating real-world constraints and enterprise-level decision processes\nencountered in large, complex megaprojects."}

To address these issues, this paper\nproposes an advanced anomaly detection framework with three main phases. First,\ndata preprocessing is performed using the Median KS Test to remove noise,\nhandle missing values, and balance datasets for cleaner input. Second, a\nfeature selection phase employs a Genetic Algorithm combined with eagle\ninspired search strategies to identify the most relevant features, reduce\ndimensionality, and improve efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.

In this paper, instead of probing\nthese issues one at a time, we take a broader view of the reward hacking\nproblem as shortcut behaviors and introduce a principled yet flexible approach\nto mitigate shortcut behaviors in preference-based reward learning. Inspired by\nthe invariant theory in the kernel perspective, we propose Preference-based\nReward Invariance for Shortcut Mitigation (PRISM), which learns group-invariant\nkernels with feature maps in a closed-form learning objective.

The software (model) is now only minimally altered\nby tuning the activations of few neurons to produce uniquely high activation\nvalues when a trigger is present. A malicious hardware Trojan detects those\nunique activations by monitoring the corresponding neurons' most significant\nbit or the 8-bit exponents and triggers another hardware Trojan to directly\nmanipulate the final output logits for misclassification.\n  This decoupled design is highly stealthy, as the model itself contains no\ncomplete backdoor activation path as in conventional attacks and hence, appears\nfully benign. Empirically, across benchmarks like MNIST, CIFAR10, GTSRB, and\nImageNet, HAMLOCK achieves a near-perfect attack success rate with a negligible\nclean accuracy drop. More importantly, HAMLOCK circumvents the state-of-the-art\nmodel-level defenses without any adaptive optimization.

Existing\ndefenses either require access to model weights (fine-tuning), incur\nsubstantial utility loss (detection-based), or demand non-trivial system\nredesign (system-level). Motivated by this, we propose DataFilter, a test-time\nmodel-agnostic defense that removes malicious instructions from the data before\nit reaches the backend LLM. DataFilter is trained with supervised fine-tuning\non simulated injections and leverages both the user's instruction and the data\nto selectively strip adversarial content while preserving benign information.\nAcross multiple benchmarks, DataFilter consistently reduces the prompt\ninjection attack success rates to near zero while maintaining the LLMs'\nutility.

Simultaneously, Early Exit determines the optimal stopping point during\nthe iterative reasoning process. Both methods seek to reduce the computational\nburden. In this paper, we first identify Mode Selection as a more challenging\nvariant of the Early Exit problem, as they share similar objectives but differ\nin decision timing. While Early Exit focuses on determining the best stopping\npoint for concise reasoning at inference time, Mode Selection must make this\ndecision at the beginning of the reasoning process, relying on pre-defined fake\nthoughts without engaging in an explicit reasoning process, referred to as\nzero-step thinking.

The main results found that (a) this approach is capable of finding\nthe maximal available CVP approximation refinement in time linear in problem\nsize and (b) probabilistic computing used in conjunction with the lattice\nparameters presented can find the composite prime factors of a semiprime number\nusing up to 100x fewer lattice instances than similar quantum and classical\nmethods."}

While the term root cause analysis or RCA has been\nwidely used, different studies formulate the task differently. This is because\nthe term \"RCA\" implicitly covers tasks with distinct underlying goals. For\ninstance, the goal of localizing a faulty service for rapid triage is\nfundamentally different from identifying a specific functional bug for a\ndefinitive fix. However, previous surveys have largely overlooked these\ngoal-based distinctions, conventionally categorizing papers by input data types\n(e.g., metric-based vs. trace-based methods). This leads to the grouping of\nworks with disparate objectives, thereby obscuring the true progress and gaps\nin the field. Meanwhile, the typical audience of an RCA survey is either laymen\nwho want to know the goals and big picture of the task or RCA researchers who\nwant to figure out past research under the same task formulation. Thus, an RCA\nsurvey that organizes the related papers according to their goals is in high\ndemand. To this end, this paper presents a goal-driven framework that\neffectively categorizes and integrates 135 papers on RCA in the context of\ncloud incident management based on their diverse goals, spanning the period\nfrom 2014 to 2025. In addition to the goal-driven categorization, it discusses\nthe ultimate goal of all RCA papers as an umbrella covering different RCA\nformulations.

To ease\nhumans' efforts and address the challenge, we introduce Dara (Data-driven\nAutomated Rietveld Analysis), a framework designed to automate the robust\nidentification and refinement of multiple phases from powder XRD data. Dara\nperforms an exhaustive tree search over all plausible phase combinations within\na given chemical space and validates each hypothesis using a robust Rietveld\nrefinement routine (BGMN). Key features include structural database filtering,\nautomatic clustering of isostructural phases during tree expansion,\npeak-matching-based scoring to identify promising phases for refinement. When\nambiguity exists, Dara generates multiple hypothesis which can then be decided\nbetween by human experts or with further characteriztion tools. By enhancing\nthe reliability and accuracy of phase identification, Dara enables scalable\nanalysis of realistic complex XRD patterns and provides a foundation for\nintegration into multimodal characterization workflows, moving toward fully\nself-driving materials discovery."}

To overcome these challenges, we present Jaralyzer, a\nbytecode-centric dependency scanner for Java. Jaralyzer does not rely on the\nmetadata or the source code of the included OSS dependencies being available\nbut directly analyzes a dependency's bytecode. Our evaluation across 56 popular\nOSS components demonstrates that Jaralyzer outperforms other popular dependency\nscanners in detecting vulnerabilities within modified dependencies.

We\nargue that ensuring diversity requires decomposing correlated metrics into\northogonal feature dimensions, from which the top-scored data can be directly\nselected. Therefore, we proposed the Orthogonal Diversity-Aware Selection\n(ODiS) algorithm, which preserves both quality and diversity during data\nselection. First, ODiS evaluates data from multiple dimensions, covering\nlanguage quality, knowledge quality, and comprehension difficulty. The\nmulti-dimensional scores are then decorrelated via Principal Component Analysis\n(PCA), yielding orthogonal evaluation dimensions. For each dimension, a\nRoberta-based scorer is trained to regress the data onto PCA-projected scores,\nenabling scalable inference on large corpora. Finally, ODiS constructs the\ntraining dataset by selecting top-scored data within each orthogonal dimension,\nthereby ensuring both quality and diversity. Empirical results show that\nODiS-selected data exhibit less than 2\\% inter-dimension overlap, confirming\northogonality between dimensions. More importantly, models trained with\nODiS-selected data significantly outperform other baselines on downstream\nbenchmarks, highlighting the necessity of orthogonal, diversity-aware data\nselection for LLMs."}

To mitigate this phenomenon, existing solutions either introduce\nadditional data for further training or incorporate external or internal\ninformation during inference. However, these approaches inevitably introduce\nextra computational costs. In this paper, we observe that hallucinations in\nMLLMs are strongly associated with insufficient attention allocated to visual\ntokens. In particular, the presence of redundant visual tokens disperses the\nmodel's attention, preventing it from focusing on the most informative ones. As\na result, critical visual cues are often under-attended, which in turn\nexacerbates the occurrence of hallucinations. Building on this observation, we\npropose \\textbf{PruneHal}, a training-free, simple yet effective method that\nleverages adaptive KV cache pruning to enhance the model's focus on critical\nvisual information, thereby mitigating hallucinations. To the best of our\nknowledge, we are the first to apply token pruning for hallucination mitigation\nin MLLMs. Notably, our method don't require additional training and incurs\nnearly no extra inference cost. Moreover, PruneHal is model-agnostic and can be\nseamlessly integrated with different decoding strategies, including those\nspecifically designed for hallucination mitigation.

This study presents a semester-long randomised controlled trial\nwith 329 students in an introductory design and programming course using an\nadaptive educational platform.

As a result, information that\nlarge language models (LLMs) and AI agents process is inherently framed by\nhumans' intentions and incentives. People are adept at navigating such nuanced\ninformation: we routinely identify benevolent or self-serving motives in order\nto decide what statements to trust. For LLMs to be effective in the real world,\nthey too must critically evaluate content by factoring in the motivations of\nthe source -- for instance, weighing the credibility of claims made in a sales\npitch. In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive study of whether LLMs have\nthis capacity for motivational vigilance. We first employ controlled\nexperiments from cognitive science to verify that LLMs' behavior is consistent\nwith rational models of learning from motivated testimony, and find they\nsuccessfully discount information from biased sources in a human-like manner.\nWe then extend our evaluation to sponsored online adverts, a more naturalistic\nreflection of LLM agents' information ecosystems. In these settings, we find\nthat LLMs' inferences do not track the rational models' predictions nearly as\nclosely -- partly due to additional information that distracts them from\nvigilance-relevant considerations. However, a simple steering intervention that\nboosts the salience of intentions and incentives substantially increases the\ncorrespondence between LLMs and the rational model.
