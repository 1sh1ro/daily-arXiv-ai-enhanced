Our best model,\nCyber-Zero-32B, establishes new state-of-the-art performance among open-weight\nmodels, matching the capabilities of proprietary systems like DeepSeek-V3-0324\nand Claude-3.5-Sonnet while offering superior cost-effectiveness, and\ndemonstrating that runtime-free trajectory synthesis can effectively\ndemocratize the development of state-of-the-art cybersecurity agents."}

As symbiosis grows, AI\nsystems pose greater ethical risks, including harm to human rights and trust.\nEthical Risk Assessment (ERA) thus becomes crucial for guiding decisions that\nminimize such risks. However, ERA is hindered by uncertainty, vagueness, and\nincomplete information, and morality itself is context-dependent and imprecise.\nThis motivates the need for a flexible, transparent, yet robust framework for\nERA. Our work supports ethical decision-making by quantitatively assessing and\nprioritizing multiple ethical risks so that artificial agents can select\nactions aligned with human values and acceptable risk levels. We introduce\nff4ERA, a fuzzy framework that integrates Fuzzy Logic, the Fuzzy Analytic\nHierarchy Process (FAHP), and Certainty Factors (CF) to quantify ethical risks\nvia an Ethical Risk Score (ERS) for each risk type. The final ERS combines the\nFAHP-derived weight, propagated CF, and risk level. The framework offers a\nrobust mathematical approach for collaborative ERA modeling and systematic,\nstep-by-step analysis. A case study confirms that ff4ERA yields\ncontext-sensitive, ethically meaningful risk scores reflecting both expert\ninput and sensor-based evidence. Risk scores vary consistently with relevant\nfactors while remaining robust to unrelated inputs. Local sensitivity analysis\nshows predictable, mostly monotonic behavior across perturbations, and global\nSobol analysis highlights the dominant influence of expert-defined weights and\ncertainty factors, validating the model design. Overall, the results\ndemonstrate ff4ERA ability to produce interpretable, traceable, and risk-aware\nethical assessments, enabling what-if analyses and guiding designers in\ncalibrating membership functions and expert judgments for reliable ethical\ndecision support."}

At a high level, BlockA2A adopts\ndecentralized identifiers (DIDs) to enable fine-grained cross-domain agent\nauthentication, blockchain-anchored ledgers to enable immutable auditability,\nand smart contracts to dynamically enforce context-aware access control\npolicies. BlockA2A eliminates centralized trust bottlenecks, ensures message\nauthenticity and execution integrity, and guarantees accountability across\nagent interactions. Furthermore, we propose a Defense Orchestration Engine\n(DOE) that actively neutralizes attacks through real-time mechanisms, including\nByzantine agent flagging, reactive execution halting, and instant permission\nrevocation. Empirical evaluations demonstrate BlockA2A's effectiveness in\nneutralizing prompt-based, communication-based, behavioral and systemic MAS\nattacks. We formalize its integration into existing MAS and showcase a\npractical implementation for Google's A2A protocol.

However, a significant scientific challenge is the lack of\nrigorous risk control and reliable uncertainty quantification in existing\ndiagnostic models, particularly when facing complex scenarios such as\ndistributional shifts. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel fault\ndetection method that integrates significance testing with the conformal\nprediction framework to provide formal risk guarantees. The method transforms\nfault detection into a hypothesis testing task by defining a nonconformity\nmeasure based on model residuals. It then leverages a calibration dataset to\ncompute p-values for new samples, which are used to construct prediction sets\nmathematically guaranteed to contain the true label with a user-specified\nprobability, $1-\\alpha$. Fault classification is subsequently performed by\nanalyzing the intersection of the constructed prediction set with predefined\nnormal and fault label sets. Experimental results on cross-domain fault\ndiagnosis tasks validate the theoretical properties of our approach. The\nproposed method consistently achieves an empirical coverage rate at or above\nthe nominal level ($1-\\alpha$), demonstrating robustness even when the\nunderlying point-prediction models perform poorly. Furthermore, the results\nreveal a controllable trade-off between the user-defined risk level ($\\alpha$)\nand efficiency, where higher risk tolerance leads to smaller average prediction\nset sizes. This research contributes a theoretically grounded framework for\nfault detection that enables explicit risk control, enhancing the\ntrustworthiness of diagnostic systems in safety-critical applications and\nadvancing the field from simple point predictions to informative,\nuncertainty-aware outputs."}

Each of these problems has its quirks, meaning there needs to be\ndifferent approaches to each, so we matched the models to the shape of the\nproblem. For intrusion detection, catching things like unauthorized access, we\ntested unsupervised anomaly detection methods. Isolation forests and deep\nautoencoders both gave us useful signals by picking up odd patterns in network\ntraffic. When it came to malware detection, we leaned on ensemble models like\nRandom Forest and XGBoost, trained on features pulled from files and traffic\nlogs. Phishing was more straightforward. We fed standard classifiers (logistic\nregression, Random Forest, XGBoost) a mix of email and web-based features.\nThese models handled the task surprisingly well. Phishing turned out to be the\neasiest problem to crack, at least with the data we had. There was a different\nstory. We utilized an LSTM autoencoder to identify behavioral anomalies in user\nactivity logs. It caught every suspicious behavior but flagged a lot of\nharmless ones too. That kind of model makes sense when the cost of missing a\nthreat is high and you are willing to sift through some noise. What we saw\nacross the board is that performance was not about stacking the most complex\nmodel. What mattered was how well the models structure matched the way the data\nbehaved. When signals were strong and obvious, simple models worked fine. But\nfor messier, more subtle threats, we needed something more adaptive, sequence\nmodels and anomaly detectors, though they brought their trade offs. The\ntakeaway here is clear in cybersecurity, context drives the solution."}

However, since models are\ntrained on human-generated data, they may inherit cognitive biases that\nsystematically distort human judgment, including escalation of commitment,\nwhere decision-makers continue investing in failing courses of action due to\nprior investment. Understanding when LLMs exhibit such biases presents a unique\nchallenge. While these biases are well-documented in humans, it remains unclear\nwhether they manifest consistently in LLMs or require specific triggering\nconditions. This paper investigates this question using a two-stage investment\ntask across four experimental conditions: model as investor, model as advisor,\nmulti-agent deliberation, and compound pressure scenario. Across N = 6,500\ntrials, we find that bias manifestation in LLMs is highly context-dependent. In\nindividual decision-making contexts (Studies 1-2, N = 4,000), LLMs demonstrate\nstrong rational cost-benefit logic with minimal escalation of commitment.\nHowever, multi-agent deliberation reveals a striking hierarchy effect (Study 3,\nN = 500): while asymmetrical hierarchies show moderate escalation rates\n(46.2%), symmetrical peer-based decision-making produces near-universal\nescalation (99.2%). Similarly, when subjected to compound organizational and\npersonal pressures (Study 4, N = 2,000), models exhibit high degrees of\nescalation of commitment (68.95% average allocation to failing divisions).\nThese findings reveal that LLM bias manifestation depends critically on social\nand organizational context rather than being inherent, with significant\nimplications for the deployment of multi-agent systems and unsupervised\noperations where such conditions may emerge naturally."}

However, its clinical deployment is\nhindered by three major sources of uncertainty. First, visual uncertainty,\ncaused by noisy or incorrect view annotations, compromises feature extraction.\nSecond, label distribution uncertainty, stemming from long-tailed disease\nprevalence, biases models against rare but clinically critical conditions.\nThird, contextual uncertainty, introduced by unverified historical reports,\noften leads to factual hallucinations. These challenges collectively limit the\nreliability and clinical trustworthiness of MRG systems. To address these\nissues, we propose SURE-Med, a unified framework that systematically reduces\nuncertainty across three critical dimensions: visual, distributional, and\ncontextual. To mitigate visual uncertainty, a Frontal-Aware View Repair\nResampling module corrects view annotation errors and adaptively selects\ninformative features from supplementary views. To tackle label distribution\nuncertainty, we introduce a Token Sensitive Learning objective that enhances\nthe modeling of critical diagnostic sentences while reweighting\nunderrepresented diagnostic terms, thereby improving sensitivity to infrequent\nconditions. To reduce contextual uncertainty, our Contextual Evidence Filter\nvalidates and selectively incorporates prior information that aligns with the\ncurrent image, effectively suppressing hallucinations. Extensive experiments on\nthe MIMIC-CXR and IU-Xray benchmarks demonstrate that SURE-Med achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance.

However, both have inherent limitations\nin practice: passive defenses are vulnerable to common non-i.i.d. data\ndistributions and random participation of FL clients, whereas current proactive\ndefenses suffer inevitable out-of-distribution (OOD) bias because they rely on\nbackdoor co-existence effects. To address these issues, we introduce a new\nproactive defense, dubbed Coward, inspired by our discovery of multi-backdoor\ncollision effects, in which consecutively planted, distinct backdoors\nsignificantly suppress earlier ones.

Engineering product design lies at the\nintersection of these difficult tasks, providing new challenges for AI\ncapabilities. Bike-Bench evaluates AI models' capability to generate designs\nthat not only resemble the dataset, but meet specific performance objectives\nand constraints. To do so, Bike-Bench quantifies a variety of human-centered\nand multiphysics performance characteristics, such as aerodynamics, ergonomics,\nstructural mechanics, human-rated usability, and similarity to subjective text\nor image prompts. Supporting the benchmark are several datasets of simulation\nresults, a dataset of 10K human-rated bicycle assessments, and a\nsynthetically-generated dataset of 1.4M designs, each with a parametric,\nCAD/XML, SVG, and PNG representation. Bike-Bench is uniquely configured to\nevaluate tabular generative models, LLMs, design optimization, and hybrid\nalgorithms side-by-side.

Maintaining reliable\nconnectivity in these cases requires frequent switching between satellite\nbeams, constellations, or orbits. To enhance user experience and address\nchallenges like long switching times, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can\nanalyze historical connectivity data and predict network quality at specific\nlocations.

While fusing multiple domains often\npresumes enhanced accuracy, this work demonstrates that adding modalities can\nyield diminishing returns, as not all fusions are inherently advantageous. To\nvalidate this, five deep learning models were designed, developed, and\nrigorously evaluated: three unimodal (1D-CNN for time, 2D-CNN for\ntime-frequency, and 1D-CNN-Transformer for frequency) and two multimodal\n(Hybrid 1, which fuses 1D-CNN and 2D-CNN; Hybrid 2, which combines 1D-CNN,\n2D-CNN, and a Transformer). For ECG classification, bootstrapping and Bayesian\ninference revealed that Hybrid 1 consistently outperformed the 2D-CNN baseline\nacross all metrics (p-values < 0.05, Bayesian probabilities > 0.90), confirming\nthe synergistic complementarity of the time and time-frequency domains.\nConversely, Hybrid 2's inclusion of the frequency domain offered no further\nimprovement and sometimes a marginal decline, indicating representational\nredundancy; a phenomenon further substantiated by a targeted ablation study.\nThis research redefines a fundamental principle of multimodal design in\nbiomedical signal analysis. We demonstrate that optimal domain fusion isn't\nabout the number of modalities, but the quality of their inherent\ncomplementarity. This paradigm-shifting concept moves beyond purely heuristic\nfeature selection. Our novel theoretical contribution, \"Complementary Feature\nDomains in Multimodal ECG Deep Learning,\" presents a mathematically\nquantifiable framework for identifying ideal domain combinations, demonstrating\nthat optimal multimodal performance arises from the intrinsic\ninformation-theoretic complementarity among fused domains."}

To evaluate AdaCoRe approaches,\nincluding our SOP, we create a new \\textit{Content Restriction Benchmark}\n(CoReBench), which contains 400 prompts for 80 restricted terms across 8\ncarefully selected categories.

To address this issue, this paper proposes a Full-stage\nRefined Proposal (FRP) algorithm aimed at eliminating these false positives\nwithin a two-stage CNN-based pedestrian detection framework. The main\ninnovation of this work lies in employing various pedestrian feature\nre-evaluation strategies to filter out low-quality pedestrian proposals during\nboth the training and testing stages. Specifically, in the training phase, the\nTraining mode FRP algorithm (TFRP) introduces a novel approach for validating\npedestrian proposals to effectively guide the model training process, thereby\nconstructing a model with strong capabilities for false positive suppression.\nDuring the inference phase, two innovative strategies are implemented: the\nClassifier-guided FRP (CFRP) algorithm integrates a pedestrian classifier into\nthe proposal generation pipeline to yield high-quality proposals through\npedestrian feature evaluation, and the Split-proposal FRP (SFRP) algorithm\nvertically divides all proposals, sending both the original and the sub-region\nproposals to the subsequent subnetwork to evaluate their confidence scores,\nfiltering out those with lower sub-region pedestrian confidence scores.

To formalize this, we propose\nWeb-CogKnowledge Framework, categorizing knowledge as Factual, Conceptual, and\nProcedural. In this framework, knowledge content learning corresponds to the\nagent's processes of Memorizing and Understanding, which rely on the first two\nknowledge types, representing the \"what\" of learning. Conversely, cognitive\nprocesses correspond to Exploring, grounded in Procedural knowledge, defining\nthe \"how\" of reasoning and action.

Its compact adapter matrices also quantize\nto 8- or 4-bit with less accuracy degradation than LoRA, enabling further\nmemory and storage savings for on-device deployment. We benchmark on DistilBERT\nand Mistral-7B across five tasks (PIQA, HellaSwag, WinoGrande, ARC-Easy,\nARC-Challenge) over multiple epochs of adapter-only tuning: on DistilBERT, an\n840 K-parameter Kron-LoRA matches LoRA-16's performance, and on Mistral-7B, a\n5.7 M-parameter Kron-LoRA rivals LoRA-8 with modest memory savings and only a\n3-8\\% speed overhead. In sequential fine-tuning from ARC-Challenge to ARC-Easy,\nKron-LoRA retains 55.18\\% accuracy versus 53.17\\% for LoRA-8-despite using only\none-quarter of the adapter parameters-underscoring its competitive cross-task\ntransfer performance. By uniting Kronecker structure, low-rank compression,\nquantization-friendliness, and by providing transparent trade-off analysis,\nKron-LoRA offers a scalable, sustainable, and continual-learning-ready solution\nfor multi-task adaptation of large language models."}

To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic\nempirical analysis of the entropy-performance exchange mechanism of RLVR across\ndifferent levels of granularity.

Specifically, FAIR-Pruner first evaluates\nthe importance of each unit (e.g., neuron or channel) through the Utilization\nScore quantified by the Wasserstein distance.

By exploring this, this paper introduces the\nforgetting curve and proposes Spatio-Temporal periodic Interest Modeling (STIM)\nwith long sequences for local-life service recommendation. STIM integrates\nthree key components: a dynamic masking module based on the forgetting curve,\nwhich is used to extract both recent spatiotemporal features and periodic\nspatiotemporal features; a query-based mixture of experts (MoE) approach that\ncan adaptively activate expert networks under different dynamic masks, enabling\nthe collaborative modeling of time, location, and items; and a hierarchical\nmulti-interest network unit, which captures multi-interest representations by\nmodeling the hierarchical interactions between the shallow and deep semantics\nof users' recent behaviors.

This hybrid dual feedback mechanism enables self-correcting\nprogram synthesis with minimal human supervision. Our results demonstrate that\nHyCodePolicy significantly improves the robustness and sample efficiency of\nrobot manipulation policies, offering a scalable strategy for integrating\nmultimodal reasoning into autonomous decision-making pipelines."}

This paper introduces a novel\ncontinuous-time mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to solve this\nintegrated spatio-temporal problem. By treating time as a continuous variable,\nour formulation overcomes the scalability limitations of traditional\ndiscrete-time approaches. The performance of the exact model is benchmarked\nagainst a constructive heuristic, and its practical applicability is\ndemonstrated through a custom-built visualization dashboard. Computational\nresults are compelling: the model solves instances with up to 25 aircraft to\nproven optimality, often in mere seconds, and for large-scale cases of up to 40\naircraft, delivers high-quality solutions within known optimality gaps. In all\ntested scenarios, the resulting solutions consistently and significantly\noutperform the heuristic, which highlights the framework's substantial economic\nbenefits and provides valuable managerial insights into the trade-off between\nsolution time and optimality."}
