What we need is\na systematic approach that not only tests functions in isolation but also\nvalidates their behavior within the broader program context, ensuring that\ndetected vulnerabilities are both reachable and triggerable. We develop a\nthree-stage bottom-up testing scheme: (1) identify likely-vulnerable functions\nand generate type- and context-aware harnesses; (2) fuzz to find crashes and\nextract input constraints via symbolic execution; (3) verify crashes by\ncombining constraints to remove false positives.

Existing approaches typically address isolated phases of the\nDevSecOps lifecycle, lacking an integrated and comprehensive security strategy.\nTo bridge this gap, we propose FaaSGuard, a unified DevSecOps pipeline\nexplicitly designed for open-source serverless environments. FaaSGuard\nsystematically embeds lightweight, fail-closed security checks into every stage\nof the development lifecycle-planning, coding, building, deployment, and\nmonitoring-effectively addressing threats such as injection attacks, hard-coded\nsecrets, and resource exhaustion. We validate our approach empirically through\na case study involving 20 real-world serverless functions from public GitHub\nrepositories.

This hardware dependency fundamentally limits the scope of\nrobotic intelligence. Here, we present INGRID (Intelligent Generative Robotic\nDesign), a framework that enables the automated design of parallel robotic\nmechanisms through deep integration with reciprocal screw theory and kinematic\nsynthesis methods. We decompose the design challenge into four progressive\ntasks: constraint analysis, kinematic joint generation, chain construction, and\ncomplete mechanism design. INGRID demonstrates the ability to generate novel\nparallel mechanisms with both fixed and variable mobility, discovering\nkinematic configurations not previously documented in the literature. We\nvalidate our approach through three case studies demonstrating how INGRID\nassists users in designing task-specific parallel robots based on desired\nmobility requirements. By bridging the gap between mechanism theory and machine\nlearning, INGRID enables researchers without specialized robotics training to\ncreate custom parallel mechanisms, thereby decoupling advances in robotic\nintelligence from hardware constraints.

Python packages, as units\nof organization, reusability, and distribution, have become a pressing concern,\nhighlighted by the considerable number of vulnerability reports. As a scripting\nlanguage, Python often cooperates with other languages for performance or\ninteroperability. This adds complexity to the vulnerabilities inherent to\nPython packages, and the effectiveness of current vulnerability detection tools\nremains underexplored. This paper addresses these gaps by introducing PyVul,\nthe first comprehensive benchmark suite of Python-package vulnerabilities.\nPyVul includes 1,157 publicly reported, developer-verified vulnerabilities,\neach linked to its affected packages. To accommodate diverse detection\ntechniques, it provides annotations at both commit and function levels. An\nLLM-assisted data cleansing method is incorporated to improve label accuracy,\nachieving 100% commit-level and 94% function-level accuracy, establishing PyVul\nas the most precise large-scale Python vulnerability benchmark. We further\ncarry out a distribution analysis of PyVul, which demonstrates that\nvulnerabilities in Python packages involve multiple programming languages and\nexhibit a wide variety of types. Moreover, our analysis reveals that\nmulti-lingual Python packages are potentially more susceptible to\nvulnerabilities. Evaluation of state-of-the-art detectors using this benchmark\nreveals a significant discrepancy between the capabilities of existing tools\nand the demands of effectively identifying real-world security issues in Python\npackages.
