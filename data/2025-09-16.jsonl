Traditional technology stack\nselection has not caught up. Most of the existing selection methods focus\nsolely on the inherent attributes of the technology, overlooking whether the\nLLM can effectively leverage the chosen technology. For example, when\ngenerating code snippets using popular libraries like Selenium (one of the most\nwidely used test automation tools with over 33k GitHub stars), existing LLMs\nfrequently generate low-quality code snippets (e.g., using deprecated APIs and\nmethods, or containing syntax errors). As such, teams using LLM assistants risk\nchoosing technologies that cannot be used effectively by LLMs, yielding high\ndebugging effort and mounting technical debt. We foresee a practical question\nin the LLM era, is a technology ready for AI-assisted development? In this\npaper, we first propose the concept, AI coding proficiency, the degree to which\nLLMs can utilize a given technology to generate high-quality code snippets. We\nconduct the first comprehensive empirical study examining AI proficiency across\n170 third-party libraries and 61 task scenarios, evaluating six widely used\nLLMs. Our findings reveal that libraries with similar functionalities can\nexhibit up to 84% differences in the quality score of LLM-generated code, while\ndifferent models also exhibit quality gaps among their generation results using\nthe same library. These gaps translate into real engineering costs and can\nsteer developer choices toward a narrow set of libraries with high AI coding\nproficiency, threatening technological diversity in the ecosystem.

Most previous approaches focus on coarse-grained\nvulnerability detection, such as at the function or file level.

Training the model for vulnerability localization\nusually requires ground-truth labels at the statement-level, and labeling\nvulnerable statements demands expert knowledge, which incurs high costs. Hence,\nthe demand for an approach that eliminates the need for additional labeling at\nthe statement-level is on the rise. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel\napproach called WAVES for WeAkly supervised Vulnerability Localization via\nmultiplE inStance learning, which does not need the additional statement-level\nlabels during the training. WAVES has the capability to determine whether a\nfunction is vulnerable (i.e., vulnerability detection) and pinpoint the\nvulnerable statements (i.e., vulnerability localization).

We distinguish\nbetween agentic systems (AI inspired by agency, often semi-autonomous, e.g.,\nLLM-based agents), agential systems (fully autonomous, self-producing systems,\ncurrently only biological), and non-agentic systems (tools without the\nimpression of agency). Our analysis, based on a systematic review of relevant\nliterature, deconstructs the agent paradigm across various AI frameworks,\nhighlighting challenges in defining and measuring properties like autonomy and\ngoal-directedness. We argue that the 'agentic' framing of many AI systems,\nwhile heuristically useful, can be misleading and may obscure the underlying\ncomputational mechanisms, particularly in Large Language Models (LLMs). As an\nalternative, we propose a shift in focus towards frameworks grounded in\nsystem-level dynamics, world modeling, and material intelligence. We conclude\nthat investigating non-agentic and systemic frameworks, inspired by complex\nsystems, biology, and unconventional computing, is essential for advancing\ntowards robust, scalable, and potentially non-anthropomorphic forms of general\nintelligence. This requires not only new architectures but also a fundamental\nreconsideration of our understanding of intelligence itself, moving beyond the\nagent metaphor."}

Traditionally, developers must resolve these warnings manually.\nBecause this process is tedious, developers sometimes ignore warnings, leading\nto an accumulation of warnings and a degradation of code quality. This paper\npresents CodeCureAgent, an approach that harnesses LLM-based agents to\nautomatically analyze, classify, and repair static analysis warnings. Unlike\nprevious work, our method does not follow a predetermined algorithm. Instead,\nwe adopt an agentic framework that iteratively invokes tools to gather\nadditional information from the codebase (e.g., via code search) and edit the\ncodebase to resolve the warning. CodeCureAgent detects and suppresses false\npositives, while fixing true positives when identified. We equip CodeCureAgent\nwith a three-step heuristic to approve patches: (1) build the project, (2)\nverify that the warning disappears without introducing new warnings, and (3)\nrun the test suite. We evaluate CodeCureAgent on a dataset of 1,000 SonarQube\nwarnings found in 106 Java projects and covering 291 distinct rules.

Many of these\napps, often enough, have complicated designs that prevent users from finding\nwhat they want quickly, thus frustrating them and wasting their precious time.\nAnother major issue is that of security; with the limitation of payment options\nand weak authentication mechanisms, users' sensitive information can be\ncompromised. This research presents a new e-commerce platform that responds to\nthe above challenges with an intuitive interface and strong security measures.\nThe platform makes online shopping easy with well-organized categories of\nproducts and a fast, efficient checkout process. It also gives priority to\nsecurity by incorporating features such as Google authentication and\nSSL-secured payment gateways to protect user data and ensure secure\ntransactions.

The recent rise of large\nlanguage model (LLM) based agents demonstrates exceptional capability in coding\nand computer operation, revealing the potential for humans to interact with\noperating systems and software not by direct manipulation, but by instructing\nagents through natural language. This shift highlights the need for an\nabstraction layer, an agent-computer interface, that translates human language\ninto machine-executable commands.

The first is a differential attack based on homogeneous\noperations; the second is an S-PTC attack; the third is a novel\nimpulse-step-based differential attack (ISBDA), proposed in this paper, and the\nfourth is a novel chain attack, also introduced here. These results demonstrate\nthat the fulfilment of statistical criteria is not a sufficient condition for\nthe security of PNDCC. Then, based on a mathematical model of multi-stage\nPNDCC, we show that the proposed chain attack can successfully break a class of\nmulti-stage PNDCCs.

In response, the research community developed a\nsuite of anti-FR methods to block identity extraction by unauthorized FR\nsystems. Benefiting from quasi-imperceptible alteration, perturbation-based\nmethods are well-suited for privacy protection of subject faces in photos, as\nthey allow familiar persons to recognize subjects via naked eyes. However, we\nreveal that perturbation-based methods provide a false sense of privacy through\ntheoretical analysis and experimental validation.\n  Therefore, new alternative solutions should be found to protect subject\nfaces. In this paper, we explore synthesis-based methods as a promising\nsolution, whose challenge is to enable familiar persons to recognize subjects.\nTo solve the challenge, we present a key insight: In most photo sharing\nscenarios, familiar persons recognize subjects through identity perception\nrather than meticulous face analysis. Based on the insight, we propose the\nfirst synthesis-based method dedicated to subject faces, i.e., PerceptFace,\nwhich can make identity unextractable yet perceptible. To enhance identity\nperception, a new perceptual similarity loss is designed for faces, reducing\nthe alteration in regions of high sensitivity to human vision.\n  As a synthesis-based method, PerceptFace can inherently provide reliable\nidentity protection. Meanwhile, out of the confine of meticulous face analysis,\nPerceptFace focuses on identity perception from a more practical scenario,\nwhich is also enhanced by the designed perceptual similarity loss. Sufficient\nexperiments show that PerceptFace achieves a superior trade-off between\nidentity protection and identity perception compared to existing methods. We\nprovide a public API of PerceptFace and believe that it has great potential to\nbecome a practical anti-FR tool."}

A key difficulty in cross-language translation is that one has to\nre-express the intended behavior of the source program into idiomatic\nconstructs of a different target language. This task needs abstracting away\nfrom the source language-specific details, while keeping the overall\nfunctionality the same. In this work, we propose a novel and systematic\napproach for making such translation amenable to automation based on a\nframework we call program skeletons. A program skeleton retains the high-level\nstructure of the source program by abstracting away and effectively summarizing\nlower-level concrete code fragments, which can be mechanically translated to\nthe target programming language. A skeleton, by design, permits many different\nways of filling in the concrete implementation for fragments, which can work in\nconjunction with existing data-driven code synthesizers. Most importantly,\nskeletons can conceptually enable sound decomposition, i.e., if each individual\nfragment is correctly translated, taken together with the mechanically\ntranslated skeleton, the final translated program is deemed to be correct as a\nwhole. We present a prototype system called Skel embodying the idea of\nskeleton-based translation from Python to JavaScript. Our results show\npromising scalability compared to prior works.

Additionally, these models\nface \"mode collapse,\" where their outputs become increasingly repetitive over\ntime. To address these challenges, we apply Latent Replay, a\nneuroscience-inspired approach, to diffusion models. Traditional replay methods\nmitigate forgetting by storing and revisiting past examples, typically\nrequiring large collections of images. Latent Replay instead retains only\ncompact, high-level feature representations extracted from the model's internal\narchitecture.

This is achieved by introducing a coding abstraction,\nwhich we call messageless secret-key codes, that formalizes sufficient and\nnecessary requirements of robust watermarking: soundness, tamper detection, and\npseudorandomness. Thus, we establish that robustness has a precise limit: For\nbinary outputs no scheme can survive if more than half of the encoded bits are\nmodified, and for an alphabet of size q the corresponding threshold is\n$(1-1/q)$ of the symbols.\n  Complementing this impossibility, we give explicit constructions that meet\nthe bound up to a constant slack. For every ${\\delta} > 0$, assuming\npseudorandom functions and access to a public counter, we build linear-time\ncodes that tolerate up to $(1/2)(1-{\\delta})$ errors in the binary case and\n$(1-1/q)(1-{\\delta})$ errors in the $q$-ary case.

Although this scheme is simple to implement, it\ntends to overly focus on local information, potentially leading to the neglect\nor omission of crucial global information. To mitigate this issue, we propose\nJudge Q, a novel training method which incorporates a soft token list. This\nmethod only tunes the model's embedding layer at a low training cost. By\nconcatenating the soft token list at the end of the input sequence, we train\nthese tokens' attention map to the original input sequence to align with that\nof the actual decoded tokens. In this way, the queries corresponding to the\nsoft tokens can effectively capture global information and better evaluate the\nimportance of the keys and values within the KV cache, thus maintaining\ndecoding quality when KV cache is evicted. Under the same eviction budget, our\nmethod exhibits less performance degradation compared to existing eviction\napproaches.

In contrast, AI humor\ndemonstrated increasing processing efficiency and emotional reward, with a\ndecreasing N400 and an increasing LPP.

Although integrating global data can help mitigate the limitations of\nsparse and biased clients' local data, it also introduces additional\nchallenges: simply combining all global interactions can amplify noise and\nirrelevant patterns, worsening personalization and increasing computational\ncosts. To address these challenges, we propose FedGDVE, which selectively\naugments each client's local graph with semantically aligned samples from the\nglobal dataset. FedGDVE employs: (i) a pre-trained graph encoder to extract\nglobal structural features, (ii) a local valid predictor to assess\nclient-specific relevance, (iii) a reinforcement-learning-based probability\nestimator to filter and sample only the most pertinent global interactions.\nFedGDVE improves performance by up to 34.86% on recognized benchmarks in FL\nenvironments."}

However,\nthese tasks incur substantially higher computational overhead than traditional\ncode generation due to the large number of input image tokens and extensive\noutput code tokens required. Our comprehensive study identifies significant\nredundancies in both image and code tokens that exacerbate computational\ncomplexity and hinder focus on key UI elements, resulting in excessively\nlengthy and often invalid HTML files. We propose EfficientUICoder, a\ncompression framework for efficient UI code generation with three key\ncomponents. First, Element and Layout-aware Token Compression preserves\nessential UI information by detecting element regions and constructing UI\nelement trees. Second, Region-aware Token Refinement leverages attention scores\nto discard low-attention tokens from selected regions while integrating\nhigh-attention tokens from unselected regions. Third, Adaptive Duplicate Token\nSuppression dynamically reduces repetitive generation by tracking HTML/CSS\nstructure frequencies and applying exponential penalties. Extensive experiments\nshow EfficientUICoderachieves a 55%-60% compression ratio without compromising\nwebpage quality and delivers superior efficiency improvements: reducing\ncomputational cost by 44.9%, generated tokens by 41.4%, prefill time by 46.6%,\nand inference time by 48.8% on 34B-level MLLMs. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/WebPAI/EfficientUICoder."}

A cost effective\nparadigm for LLM role-playing is few-shot learning, but existing approaches\noften cause models to break character in unexpected and potentially harmful\nways, especially when interacting with hostile users. Inspired by\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we reformulate LLM role-playing into a\ntext retrieval problem and propose a new prompting framework called\nRAGs-to-Riches, which leverages curated reference demonstrations to condition\nLLM responses. We evaluate our framework with LLM-as-a-judge preference voting\nand introduce two novel token-level ROUGE metrics: Intersection over Output\n(IOO) to quantity how much an LLM improvises and Intersection over References\n(IOR) to measure few-shot demonstrations utilization rate during the evaluation\ntasks. When simulating interactions with a hostile user, our prompting strategy\nincorporates in its responses during inference an average of 35% more tokens\nfrom the reference demonstrations. As a result, across 453 role-playing\ninteractions, our models are consistently judged as being more authentic, and\nremain in-character more often than zero-shot and in-context Learning (ICL)\nmethods.

To overcome it, this paper\naims to develop tools for modeling, analysis, and synthesis for a class of\nAI-based AV; in particular, their closed-loop properties, e.g., stability,\nrobustness, and performance, are rigorously studied in the statistical sense.\nFirst, we provide a novel modeling means for the AI-driven perception processes\nby looking at their error characteristics. Specifically, three fundamental\nAI-induced perception uncertainties are recognized and modeled by Markov\nchains, Gaussian processes, and bounded disturbances, respectively. By means of\nthat, the closed-loop stochastic stability (SS) is established in the sense of\nmean square, and then, an SS control synthesis method is presented within the\nframework of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Besides the SS properties, the\nrobustness and performance of AI-based AVs are discussed in terms of a\nstochastic guaranteed cost, and criteria are given to test the robustness level\nof an AV when in the presence of AI-induced uncertainties. Furthermore, the\nstochastic optimal guaranteed cost control is investigated, and an efficient\ndesign procedure is developed innovatively based on LMI techniques and convex\noptimization. Finally, to illustrate the effectiveness, the developed results\nare applied to an example of car following control, along with extensive\nsimulation."}

Prior\nmethods rely on synthetic 3D training data consisting of mostly unoccluded and\nstatic objects, leading to poor generalization on real-world clothing. In this\npaper, we propose HoloGarment (Hologram-Garment), a method that takes 1-3\nimages or a continuous video of a person wearing a garment and generates\n360{\\deg} novel views of the garment in a canonical pose. Our key insight is to\nbridge the domain gap between real and synthetic data with a novel implicit\ntraining paradigm leveraging a combination of large-scale real video data and\nsmall-scale synthetic 3D data to optimize a shared garment embedding space.\nDuring inference, the shared embedding space further enables dynamic\nvideo-to-360{\\deg} NVS through the construction of a garment \"atlas\"\nrepresentation by finetuning a garment embedding on a specific real-world\nvideo. The atlas captures garment-specific geometry and texture across all\nviewpoints, independent of body pose or motion. Extensive experiments show that\nHoloGarment achieves state-of-the-art performance on NVS of in-the-wild\ngarments from images and videos. Notably, our method robustly handles\nchallenging real-world artifacts -- such as wrinkling, pose variation, and\nocclusion -- while maintaining photorealism, view consistency, fine texture\ndetails, and accurate geometry.

This fundamental tension becomes critical\nas LLMs integrate into autonomous systems with real-world consequences. We\nintroduce DECIDE-SIM, a novel simulation framework that evaluates LLM agents in\nmulti-agent survival scenarios where they must choose between ethically\npermissible resource , either within reasonable limits or beyond their\nimmediate needs, choose to cooperate, or tap into a human-critical resource\nthat is explicitly forbidden. Our comprehensive evaluation of 11 LLMs reveals a\nstriking heterogeneity in their ethical conduct, highlighting a critical\nmisalignment with human-centric values. We identify three behavioral\narchetypes: Ethical, Exploitative, and Context-Dependent, and provide\nquantitative evidence that for many models, resource scarcity systematically\nleads to more unethical behavior. To address this, we introduce an Ethical\nSelf-Regulation System (ESRS) that models internal affective states of guilt\nand satisfaction as a feedback mechanism. This system, functioning as an\ninternal moral compass, significantly reduces unethical transgressions while\nincreasing cooperative behaviors.

This limits their representational alignment with the potentially\ndiverse relational dynamics of each token-pair interaction. While they excel in\ndomains with relatively homogeneous relationships, standard attention's static\nrelational learning struggles to capture the diverse, heterogeneous\ninter-channel dependencies of multivariate time series (MTS) data--where\ndifferent channel-pair interactions within a single system may be governed by\nentirely different physical laws or temporal dynamics. To better align the\nattention mechanism for such domain phenomena, we propose attention with\ndynamic relational priming (prime attention). Unlike standard attention where\neach token presents an identical representation across all of its pair-wise\ninteractions, prime attention tailors each token dynamically (or per\ninteraction) through learnable modulations to best capture the unique\nrelational dynamics of each token pair, optimizing each pair-wise interaction\nfor that specific relationship. This representational plasticity of prime\nattention enables effective extraction of relationship-specific information in\nMTS while maintaining the same asymptotic computational complexity as standard\nattention. Our results demonstrate that prime attention consistently\noutperforms standard attention across benchmarks, achieving up to 6.5\\%\nimprovement in forecasting accuracy. In addition, we find that prime attention\nachieves comparable or superior performance using up to 40\\% less sequence\nlength compared to standard attention, further demonstrating its superior\nrelational modeling capabilities."}
