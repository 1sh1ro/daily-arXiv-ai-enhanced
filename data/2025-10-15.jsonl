By employing a logically\nand physically separate parity domain to protect a primary data domain, RAID-0e\nmitigates the risk of array-wide data loss from common, non-catastrophic media\nfailures, such as isolated bad blocks, transient read errors, or sector-level\ncorruption. The architecture is engineered to preserve the intrinsic read\nperformance advantages of RAID 0 while significantly enhancing data\navailability and operational resilience. This document provides a comprehensive\nexposition of the architectural principles, operational workflows, performance\ncharacteristics, failure mode analysis, and security considerations of RAID-0e.\nIt is presented as an experimental yet pragmatic solution for environments\nseeking a new equilibrium between I/O performance, storage cost, and data\nresilience, particularly where full drive failure is a secondary concern to\nmedia degradation."}

These\nphenomena suggest the presence of path dependence in price formation, where\ninvestor decisions are influenced not only by current market conditions but\nalso by the trajectory of prices leading up to the present. Path dependence has\ndrawn attention in behavioral finance as a key mechanism behind such anomalies.\nOne plausible driver of path dependence is human loss aversion, anchored to\nindividual reference points like purchase prices or past peaks, which vary with\npersonal context. However, capturing such subtle behavioral tendencies in\ntraditional agent-based market simulations has remained a challenge. We propose\nthe Fundamental-Chartist-LLM-Agent (FCLAgent), which uses large language models\n(LLMs) to emulate human-like trading decisions. In this framework, (1) buy/sell\ndecisions are made by LLMs based on individual situations, while (2) order\nprice and volume follow standard rule-based methods. Simulations show that\nFCLAgents reproduce path-dependent patterns that conventional agents fail to\ncapture. Furthermore, an analysis of FCLAgents' behavior reveals that the\nreference points guiding loss aversion vary with market trajectories,\nhighlighting the potential of LLM-based agents to model nuanced investor\nbehavior."}

The state-of-the-art approach is to use\nLLMs as evaluators ( LLM-as-a-judge), but this suffers from a critical flaw:\nLLMs exhibit a strong positive bias. We provide empirical evidence showing that\nwhile LLMs can identify valid outputs with high accuracy (i.e., True Positive\nRate 96%), they are remarkably poor at identifying invalid ones (i.e., True\nNegative Rate <25%). This systematic bias, coupled with class imbalance, often\nleads to inflated reliability scores.\n  While ensemble-based methods like majority voting can help, we show that they\nare not good enough.

However, such approaches remain\nvulnerable against adversarial examples, i.e., examples that are subtly\nmanipulated to fool a machine learning model into making incorrect predictions.\nThis research presents DeepTrust, a novel metaheuristic that arranges flexible\nclassifiers, like deep neural networks, into an ordered sequence where the\nfinal decision is made by a single internal model based on conditions activated\nin cascade. In the Robust Android Malware Detection competition at the 2025\nIEEE Conference SaTML, DeepTrust secured the first place and achieved\nstate-of-the-art results, outperforming the next-best competitor by up to 266%\nunder feature-space evasion attacks. This is accomplished while maintaining the\nhighest detection rate on non-adversarial malware and a false positive rate\nbelow 1%. The method's efficacy stems from maximizing the divergence of the\nlearned representations among the internal models.

Promotion abuse is one of the fastest-growing types of fraud in\nrecent years and is characterized by users exploiting promotional activities to\ngain financial benefits from the platform. To investigate this issue, we\nconduct the first study on promotion abuse fraud in e-commerce platforms\nMEITUAN. We find that promotion abuse fraud is a group-based fraudulent\nactivity with two types of fraudulent activities: Stocking Up and Cashback\nAbuse. Unlike traditional fraudulent activities such as fake reviews, promotion\nabuse fraud typically involves ordinary customers conducting legitimate\ntransactions and these two types of fraudulent activities are often\nintertwined. To address this issue, we propose leveraging additional\ninformation from the spatial and temporal perspectives to detect promotion\nabuse fraud. In this paper, we introduce PROMOGUARDIAN, a novel multi-relation\nfused graph neural network that integrates the spatial and temporal information\nof transaction data into a homogeneous graph to detect promotion abuse fraud.\nWe conduct extensive experiments on real-world data from MEITUAN, and the\nresults demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods in promotion abuse fraud detection, achieving 93.15% precision,\ndetecting 2.1 to 5.0 times more fraudsters, and preventing 1.5 to 8.8 times\nmore financial losses in production environments."}

We provide a number of\nalgorithms and lower bounds for this problem in different models and settings.\nWe first prove a lower bound showing that computing explicit solutions\nnecessarily incurs large error, even if we try to obtain privacy by allowing\nourselves to output non-edges. We then consider implicit solutions, where at\nthe end of the computation there is an ($\\varepsilon$-differentially private)\nbillboard and each node can determine its matched edge(s) based on what is\nwritten on this publicly visible billboard. For this solution concept, we\nprovide tight upper and lower (bicriteria) bounds, where the degree bound is\nviolated by a logarithmic factor (which we show is necessary). We further show\nthat our algorithm can be made distributed in the local edge DP (LEDP) model,\nand can even be done in a logarithmic number of rounds if we further relax the\ndegree bounds by logarithmic factors.

We present GSSBench, a task suite of prompt pairs with\nground-truth GSS relationships to assess different metrics and understand where\nmodels diverge from desired behavior. We find that hallucination detection\nmetrics, particularly EigenScore, consistently outperform standard diversity\nand uncertainty quantification metrics, while using only model internals,\nproviding interpretable insights into a model's internal task representations.\nWe demonstrate three applications of GSS: (1) detecting prompt ambiguity and\npredicting clarification questions for better grounding, (2) interpreting\noverthinking and underthinking in reasoning models, and (3) steering models to\nexpand their generation space to yield high-quality and diverse outputs."}

Yet, their adoption in\npractice has been hampered by the lack of such specifications in real world\ncode. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in inferring formal\npostconditions from natural language hints embedded in code such as function\nnames, comments or documentation. Using the generated postconditions as\nspecifications in a subsequent verification, however, often leads verifiers to\nsuggest invalid inputs, hinting at potential issues that ultimately turn out to\nbe false alarms.\n  To address this, we revisit the problem of specification inference from\nnatural language in the context of automatic software verification. In the\nprocess, we introduce NL2Contract, the task of employing LLMs to translate\ninformal natural language into formal functional contracts, consisting of\npostconditions as well as preconditions. We introduce metrics to validate and\ncompare different NL2Contract approaches, using soundness, bug discriminative\npower of the generated contracts and their usability in the context of\nautomatic software verification as key metrics. We evaluate NL2Contract with\ndifferent LLMs and compare it to the task of postcondition generation\nnl2postcond.
